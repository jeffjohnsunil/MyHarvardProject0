# MyHarvardProject0

Project0

This is my Project0 submission for the CS50's Web Programming with Javascript and Python course on Edx.
Here, I have added 5 html files, as well as 3 css files, 1 scss file, and a lot of images.

To access all of these links, there is a handy menu on the top.

Thanks,
  JEFF JOHN SUNIL
