<h1>Singing</h1>

<p>Welcome to the dedicated Singing site. In this page, you will get to know about my career in Singing.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Singing:</h2>

<p>I had gotten introduced to singing about 3 years ago. I was having fun in my school's singing class. My mom noticed this, and decided to take me to an institute for training. This institute was call the Symphony Music Learning Centre. I immediately enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I am currently in Grade 4. My passion for singing is still thriving, and I always get opportunities from my school.</p>

<h2>Achievements:</h2>

<p>In my Initial Grade exam, I had scored 97 out of 100. This ws a topper score, and I was honoured for it.</p>

<p>I have mostly gotten oppertunities from the school. To see some of these events, check out my youtube channel at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrknfg-Q0mY1y6ias_TrUiw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrknfg-Q0mY1y6ias_TrUiw</a></p>
