		<b><p>Welcome to the dedicated chess section. In this page, you will get to know all of my experiences with chess. It also cantains the basic rules of chess.</p></b>

		<h2>My Experience: Introduction to Chess</h2>

		<p>I had gotten to know chess completely by accident. I had gotten a chessboard at a friend's birthday party. It seemed like a fun game and I wanted to learn. So, my parents gave me some time to watch some videos on YouTube to understand chess better.</p>

		<p>I really started getting into it. I used to play with my dad, and it would be a 50-50 competition. But on my trip to India, I noticed something in a local bookstore.</p>

		<p>It was a chess book. I bought it and took it home. It was this book alone that gave me a base to mold on my chess. Now, I would beat my dad <b>every single time.</b></p>

		<h2>My Experience: Building up - Chess</h2>

		<p>My parents started noticing that I wasn't getting any new knowledge on chess. So, they took me the a chess club. They were the ones that made my base solid, and to build the foundation.</p>

		<p>That was also the same time that I had gotten my FIDE rating.</p>

		<p>At first, I really enjoyed it. It was so much fun to play like this. However, soon, I stopped making progress.</p>

		<h2>My Experience: Pros - Chess</h2>

		<p>I was quite good for my age. So my parents decided to hand me over to professional training. I have been going quite recently every Friday.</p>

		<p>This is currently what I am doing now. To learn about the basic rules of chess, click the link below:</p>
