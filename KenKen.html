<h1>KenKen</h1>

<p>KenKen is a Japanese puzzle similar to Sudoku. It is an official 'sport' that I am very good in. In fact, I won the International Championship.</p>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>When I was in the 3rd Grade, my teacher handed me a pamphlet about KenKen. It was very interesting, and I decided to give it a go. The school level exam, was just 1 month away from the end of summer vacation. So vacation long I practiced, and I thought I was good. But soon, I discovered that I was doing the puzzle all wrong! The exam was only a week away, but I stil managed to pass the school exam.</p>

<p>After that, the exams were a cakewalk.</p>

<p>On my first try, I came in 3rd place nationally. Second try, I came 1st place nationally and 7th place internationally. Third try, I came 1st both nationally and internationally, in my age group. Fourth try, I became the World Champion under 18! Now, I have a 3-year period on Wikipedia, and you can see it by clicking the link below:</p>
