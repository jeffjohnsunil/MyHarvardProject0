<h1>Chess Basics</h1>

<p>Chess is a war-like game, played by two sides. Each side has the same amount of players, and must beat the other with strategy. This page will talk about the basics and rules of chess. To go back to the main page, just click the link below:</p>

<h2>PIECES:</h2>

<p>There are sixteen pieces in a chess game. They are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>KING</li>
	<li>QUEEN</li>
	<li>ROOK</li>
	<li>BISHOP</li>
	<li>KNIGHT</li>
    <li>PAWN</li>
</ul>

<h3>KING:</h3>

<p>The king is the <b>MOST IMPORTANT PIECE</b> in the whole game. If you were to lose it, you'd lose the game. When your king is under attack (being under the line of attack), it's called <b>CHECK</b> and you are forced to reply by either:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Capturing the attacking piece</li>
	<img src="img/capture.png" alt="Capturing">
	<li>Blocking the check</li>
	<img src="img/block.png" alt="Blocking">
	<li>Moving the king</li>
	<img src="img/movingAway.png" alt="Moving Away">
</ul>

<p>The king is one of the least mobile pieces in the game, being able to move in all directions, but only one square at a time. It cannot move into a square controlled by an opponent's piece.</p>

<img src="img/king.png" alt="King">

<p>When none of this is possible, it is called <b>CHECKMATE</b> and it's game over.</p>

<img src="img/checkmate.png" alt="Checkmate">

<h3>QUEEN:</h3>

<p>The queen is said to be one of the most powerful piece, and for good reason, as it move just like the king, but can move as many squares as it likes. It only has one restriction, that being, it cannot pass through any piece or jump over it. It is restricted by it's teammates, and if there is an opponent piece in it's line of sight, it can capture it, i.e. remove the piece and land on it's square.</p>

<h3>ROOK:</h3>

<p>The rook is like the queen, however, it can not move diagonally. It can only move on ranks(rows) and files(columns). You get 2 of them</p>

<img src="img/rook.png" alt="Rook">

<h3>BISHOP:</h3>

<p>The bishop can only move diagonally. It has the same restrictions as the queen. You also get 2 of them.</p>

<img src="img/bishop.png" alt="Bishop">

<h3>KNIGHT:</h3>

<p>The knight is a special piece. It is the only piece capable of jumping over other pieces. It moves very weirdly, moving in an L shape (2 squares forward, 1 square side). It cannot capture pieces it jumps over, but rather captures the piece which is on the square it lands on. You also get 2 of them.</p>

<img src="img/knight.png" alt="Knight">

<h3>PAWN:</h3>

<p>The pawn is another special piece. It has the least mobility, moving only one square forward, except on it's starting square, on which it has the option of moving two squares instead of 1.</p>

<p>It can only capture that is diagonally in front of it. You get 8 of them, in front of all your pieces.</p>

<h2>BOARD SETUP:</h2>

<p>The image below shows the correct way to arrange the pieces:</p>

<h2>UNUSUAL MOVES:</h2>

<p>In chess, there are three unusual moves. They are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Castling:</li>
	<p>Castling is an important way to put your king safely in the corner. There are two ways of castling, long and short side. In castling, the king moves 2 spaces to the closest rook, and the rook jumps to the other side of the king:</p>

	<img src="img/castle1.png" alt="Castling">
	<img src="img/castle2.png" alt="Castling">

	<p>However, you cannot castle:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Out of Check:</li>
			<img src="img/outOfCheck.png" alt="Castlingno">
		<li>Through Check:</li>
			<img src="img/throughCheck.png" alt="Castlingno">
		<li>Into Check:</li>
			<img src="img/intoCheck.png" alt="Castlingno">
	</ul>

	<li>En Passant:</li>
	<p>If an opponent pawn is at it's beginning stage, and it moves 2 squares, adjacent to your pawn on the same rank, the pawn can <em>en passant</em>, meaning it can capture the pawn as if it had moved 1 step.</p>

	<img src="img/enPassant.png" alt="En Passant">

    <li>Pawn Promotion:</li>
    <p>When the pawn reaches the topmost rank, it has the option to turn into a queen, rook, bishop or knight.</p>

    <h2>Piece Value:</h2>

    <p>Each piece has a specific value which depends on its locomotion and importance. They are:</p>

    <div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
      Pawn = 1
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
      Bishop = 3
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
      Knight = 3
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
      Rook = 5
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
      Queen = 9
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</ul>
